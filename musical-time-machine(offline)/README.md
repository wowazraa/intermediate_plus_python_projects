# Musical Time Machine (Offline Version)

This project allows you to travel back in time musically by creating a Spotify playlist with the top Billboard songs from a specific date.  
It works **offline** by using local CSV files that contain Billboard Hot 100 data.

---

## Features
-  Input any date between **1958-2025** (`YYYY-MM-DD` format).
-  If the exact date does not exist in the dataset, it will automatically select the **closest available date**.
-  Reads Billboard Hot 100 charts from local CSV files stored in the `datas/` folder.
-  Creates a new Spotify playlist with the songs from that chart.
-  Uses the Spotify API for playlist creation and track search.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/)
- Spotify Developer account with:
  - **Client ID**
  - **Client Secret**
  - **Redirect URI**

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intermediate_plus_python_projects.git
cd intermediate_plus_python_projects/musical-time-machine(offline)
```
2. Install dependencies:
  ```
  pip install pandas spotipy
  ```
3. Place your Billboard CSV files inside:
  ```
  musical-time-machine(offline)/datas/
  ```
5. Create a .env file (or set environment variables) with your Spotify credentials:
  ```
  SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
  SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
  SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
  ```

---

## Usage
Run the program:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
You will be prompted to enter a date:
  ```
  Which year do you want to travel to (1958-2025)? Type YYYY-MM-DD:
  ```
If the exact date exists in datas/, that chart will be used.
If not, the script finds the closest available chart date.

A Spotify playlist will then be created with the corresponding songs.

### Notes
Some songs may not be available on Spotify.

Playlist creation requires you to log in via Spotifyâ€™s OAuth flow (browser opens automatically).

This offline version avoids web scraping by relying only on local CSV data.
